# Astro Migration Project Epic
*Modernizing Joel Lithgow Portfolio with Framework-Driven Development*

## Executive Summary

This project epic outlines the strategic migration of Joel Lithgow's portfolio from a vanilla JavaScript static site to a modern Astro.js-powered application. The migration prioritizes content management scalability, blog functionality addition, and future API integration capabilities while preserving all current performance optimizations and interactive features.

### Strategic Objectives
- **Content Management**: Establish scalable content strategy using Astro's Content Collections
- **Framework Adoption**: Leverage Astro's performance-first architecture for scaling
- **Blog Functionality**: Add professional blog with MDX support and content management
- **API Readiness**: Prepare architecture for future headless CMS and API integrations
- **Performance Preservation**: Maintain current Core Web Vitals and optimization strategies

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview
The current portfolio demonstrates excellent engineering practices:

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Critical resource preloading
- Modular JavaScript architecture with ES6 imports
- Optimized image assets (WebP, processed images)
- Performance monitoring implementation
- Service worker for offline capability

**Feature Complexity:**
- Advanced theming system (7 themes with CSS custom properties)
- Interactive floating elements with drag functionality
- Modal-based case study system
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+T theme cycling)
- Snake game easter egg with homepage navigation integration
- Responsive design with accessibility features

**Current Stack:**
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Modular component architecture
- Netlify deployment with optimizations
- Custom build process and performance monitoring

### Technical Debt Identification
1. **Content Management**: Hard-coded content in JS modules creates scaling friction
2. **Component Reusability**: HTML templates in string literals limit maintainability
3. **Build Process**: Manual optimization processes could be automated
4. **SEO Limitations**: Client-side rendering reduces search engine optimization potential
5. **Content Editing**: Non-technical content editing requires developer intervention

## Target State Vision

### Astro Architecture Benefits
**Performance First**: Astro's zero-JS default with selective hydration aligns perfectly with current performance standards
**Content Collections**: Structured content management for projects, blog posts, and case studies
**Component Islands**: Preserve interactive elements (themes, modals, games) with minimal JavaScript
**Static Site Generation**: Maintain fast loading while enabling dynamic content
**SEO Optimization**: Server-side rendering for better search engine indexing

### Technology Stack Selection
- **Framework**: Astro.js (latest stable)
- **Styling**: Preserve current CSS custom properties system
- **TypeScript**: Gradual adoption for better tooling and maintainability
- **Content**: Markdown/MDX with frontmatter for structured data
- **Deployment**: Continue with Netlify (compatible with Astro)
- **Components**: Astro native components with selective Vue.js for complex interactions

      src: z.string(),
      alt: z.string(),
      caption: z.string(),
      type: z.string().optional()
    })),
    duration: z.string(),
    team: z.string(),
    role: z.string(),
    tools: z.string(),
    publishDate: z.date(),
    featured: z.boolean().default(false)
  })
});

const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    publishDate: z.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    author: z.string().default('Joel Lithgow'),
