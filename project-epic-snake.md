## UX Design Plan

### Design System Integration
Based on analysis of the existing codebase, the game will leverage:
- **Visual Language**: Bold borders (3px), playful rotations (-2° to +2°), drop shadows with accent colors
- **Color System**: CSS custom properties with full theme compatibility (default, electric, retro, minimal, neon, high-contrast)
- **Typography**: Monaco/Menlo monospace fonts, uppercase styling, letter-spacing
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover transforms, scale effects, and color transitions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, reduced motion preferences, high contrast mode, keyboard navigation

### Game Layout & Visual Hierarchy

**Main Game Container**
```css
.snake-game {
    background: var(--bg-secondary);
    border: 3px solid var(--accent-primary);
    transform: rotate(-1deg);
    box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px var(--accent-secondary);
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 30px;
}
```

**Components:**
- Central game board (20x20 or 25x25 grid)
- Score display styled as "stat cards" similar to About section
- Theme-aware colors for snake, food, and grid
- Rotated containers matching site aesthetic

### Control Schemes

**Desktop Controls:**
- Primary: WASD keys (gamer-friendly)
- Secondary: Arrow keys (universal)
- Spacebar: Pause/Resume
- R key: Restart
- Clear on-screen control reference

**Mobile/Touch Controls:**
- Swipe gestures in four directions
- Large touch-friendly control buttons as fallback
- Visual feedback on touch interactions
- Styled with theme-consistent design

### Game States & User Experience

1. **Welcome/Menu State**: Instructions, difficulty selection, theme-consistent start button
2. **Playing State**: Active game board, live score updates, accessible pause
3. **Paused State**: Semi-transparent overlay, clear resume/restart options
4. **Game Over State**: Score summary, achievement feedback, quick restart

### Accessibility Features

- **Screen Reader**: Live region announcements for score changes and game state
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All elements focusable with clear focus indicators
- **Visual Accessibility**: High contrast support, sufficient color contrast ratios
- **Motor Accessibility**: Adjustable game speed, large touch targets, alternative controls

### Responsive Design Strategy

- **Mobile Portrait (≤480px)**: Square board, controls below, larger grid cells
- **Mobile Landscape (481px-768px)**: Horizontal layout, controls on sides
- **Tablet (769px-1024px)**: Larger board, enhanced score display
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full-featured layout, keyboard primary, extended statistics

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Rendering Strategy: Canvas 2D

**Implementation Features:**
- Device pixel ratio support for crisp graphics
- Responsive grid sizing
- Theme-aware rendering
- Performance optimized for mobile

```javascript
class SnakeRenderer {
    constructor(canvas, gridSize = 20) {
        this.canvas = canvas;
        this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        this.gridSize = gridSize;
        this.dpr = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
        this.setupCanvas();
    }
    
    setupCanvas() {
        const rect = this.canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
        this.canvas.width = rect.width * this.dpr;
        this.canvas.height = rect.height * this.dpr;
        this.ctx.scale(this.dpr, this.dpr);
        
        this.cellSize = Math.floor(Math.min(
            rect.width / this.gridSize,
            rect.height / this.gridSize
        ));
    }
}
```

### Game Loop Architecture

**High-Performance Fixed Timestep:**
- 60 FPS target with interpolation
- Separate game speed from frame rate
- Spiral of death protection
- RequestAnimationFrame optimization

```javascript
class SnakeGameEngine {
    constructor() {
        this.deltaTime = 1000 / 60; // 60 FPS target
        this.gameSpeed = 100; // ms between snake movements
        this.accumulator = 0;
    }
    
    gameLoop(currentTime) {
        const frameTime = Math.min(currentTime - this.lastTime, this.maxDelta);
        this.accumulator += frameTime;
        
        while (this.accumulator >= this.deltaTime) {
            this.update(this.deltaTime);
            this.accumulator -= this.deltaTime;
        }
        
        this.render(this.accumulator / this.deltaTime);
        requestAnimationFrame((time) => this.gameLoop(time));
    }
}
```

### State Management

**Centralized State with Event System:**
- Observable pattern for UI updates
- Local storage for high scores
- Comprehensive game statistics
- Clean separation of concerns

```javascript
class SnakeGameState {
    constructor() {
        this.state = {
            gameStatus: 'menu',
            score: 0,
            highScore: this.loadHighScore(),
            snake: { body: [{x: 10, y: 10}], direction: {x: 1, y: 0} },
            food: null,
            stats: { foodEaten: 0, distanceTraveled: 0, playTime: 0 }
        };
        this.observers = new Map();
    }
}
```

### Input Handling System

**Multi-Input Support:**
- Keyboard (WASD + Arrow keys)
- Touch gestures with swipe detection
- Gamepad support
- Input queuing for responsive controls

```javascript
class SnakeInputHandler {
    constructor(gameState) {
        this.keyBindings = {
            ArrowUp: {x: 0, y: -1},
            ArrowDown: {x: 0, y: 1},
            ArrowLeft: {x: -1, y: 0},
            ArrowRight: {x: 1, y: 0},
            w: {x: 0, y: -1}, s: {x: 0, y: 1},
            a: {x: -1, y: 0}, d: {x: 1, y: 0}
        };
        this.inputQueue = [];
        this.init();
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Object pooling for particles
- Spatial hashing for collision detection
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Memory management
- Performance monitoring with auto-optimization

```javascript
class ParticlePool {
    constructor(size = 100) {
        this.pool = [];
        this.active = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            this.pool.push(new Particle());
        }
    }
}
```

### Audio System

**Web Audio API Integration:**
- Synthesized retro sounds
- Master volume control
- Lazy initialization
- Respect user audio preferences

### Mobile Compatibility

**Responsive Features:**
- Touch-friendly controls
- Virtual D-pad overlay
- Adaptive canvas sizing
- Performance scaling
