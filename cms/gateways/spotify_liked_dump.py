"""
Spotify Liked Songs gateway — one CMS document per calendar month.

Liked tracks come back newest first, so a run only pages back as far as the
earliest month it needs to refresh, groups tracks by YYYY-MM and yields one
GatewayItem per month. Re-syncing mid-month updates that month's document with
any newly liked songs and publishes it.

Ownership. ``songs`` and ``song_count`` are machine-sourced and refreshed on
every sync that touches the month. The title, publish date and tags are seeded
when the month is first created and then belong to whoever edits them.

Ranges (``self.range``, see ``BaseGateway.sync``):
    since_last_sync  refresh every month from the one containing the cursor
                     (minus the gateway's overlap) up to now.
    all_time         every month from ``MONTH_FLOOR``.
    custom           the months containing ``start``..``end``; the floor does
                     not apply, so an explicit backfill can reach earlier.

A track you un-like disappears from its month only when that month is
refreshed again. A month before the floor is only ever touched by ``custom``.
A document is never deleted by a sync.

A month a run could not finish (a person's draft is on it, or the write failed)
is on the retry list; the next run calls :meth:`refetch`, which re-reads that
month, so it is tried again whatever the run's range.

Environment variables:
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID       Spotify application client ID
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET   Spotify application client secret
    SPOTIPY_REFRESH_TOKEN   Long-lived refresh token (preferred; obtain once
                            via ``python cms/gateways/get_spotify_token.py``)

    Legacy OAuth dance (only needed to obtain the initial refresh token):
    SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI    OAuth redirect URI (e.g. http://localhost:8888/callback)
