# Project Epic: Artworks Gallery Implementation

## Overview
Technical implementation of standalone artworks gallery page, leveraging existing Astro.js architecture and content collections. Focus on CMS integration, data structure design, and iterative prototype development.

## Technical Context
- **Current Stack**: Astro.js 5.12.8, TypeScript, content collections
- **Existing Architecture**: Content-driven site with projects collection
- **Target**: `/artworks` page as new standalone section
- **Approach**: Iterative development with placeholder data first, then CMS integration

## Phase 1: Data Structure & Schema Design

### 1.1 Define Artwork Schema
- Extend existing content collections with artworks collection
- Design flexible schema supporting individual artworks and project groupings
- Include metadata for filtering and organization

**Key Data Fields:**
```typescript
- id, title, description, date (year/range)
- medium, dimensions, location
- images[] (multiple images per artwork)
- project_id (optional - for grouping into projects)
- process_docs[] (sketches, progress shots)
- exhibition_history[] (where shown)
- availability_status, price_range (optional)
- tags[] (for filtering/search)
```

### 1.2 Create Placeholder Data Structure
- Generate 10-15 sample artworks across different mediums
- Include 2-3 project groupings (collaborative work, series)
- Prepare high-quality placeholder images

## Phase 2: Basic Page Implementation

### 2.1 Create Artworks Page
- **File**: `/src/pages/artworks.astro`
- Grid-based layout showcasing artwork thumbnails
- Basic filtering by medium/year
- Individual artwork detail views (modal or dedicated pages)

### 2.2 Artwork Components
- **ArtworkCard.astro**: Thumbnail with key metadata
- **ArtworkDetail.astro**: Full artwork view with images and description
- **ArtworkFilter.astro**: Filter controls for medium, year, project
- **ArtworkGrid.astro**: Responsive grid layout

### 2.3 Navigation Integration
- Add artworks link to existing navigation
- Ensure consistent styling with current site

## Phase 3: CMS Integration Planning

### 3.1 CMS Requirements Analysis
- Document current CMS capabilities and API structure
- Map CMS fields to artwork schema
- Identify any CMS limitations or required modifications

### 3.2 Data Fetching Strategy
- Determine build-time vs runtime data fetching needs
- Plan image optimization and CDN integration
- Design fallback strategies for CMS unavailability

## Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Post-MVP)

### 4.1 Image Optimization
- Implement Astro's image optimization
- Lazy loading and responsive images
- Lightbox/gallery functionality for multiple images per artwork

### 4.2 Search & Filtering
- Full-text search across artwork metadata
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, multiple mediums)
- URL-based filter state for shareability

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- Implement view transitions for smooth navigation
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Consider virtual scrolling for large collections

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Working `/artworks` page with placeholder data

**Tasks**:
1. Extend content collection schema for artworks
2. Create placeholder artwork data (10-15 pieces)
3. Build basic artworks page with grid layout
4. Implement simple artwork detail view
5. Add navigation integration

**Deliverable**: Functional artworks page with placeholder content

### Sprint 2: Core Features (Week 2)
**Goal**: Complete artwork viewing and basic filtering

**Tasks**:
1. Implement artwork filtering by medium/year
2. Create artwork detail modal/page
3. Add multiple image support per artwork
4. Implement responsive grid layout
5. Basic image optimization

**Deliverable**: Feature-complete artworks gallery with filtering

### Sprint 3: CMS Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Connect to existing CMS and real data

**Tasks**:
1. Analyze current CMS structure and API
2. Implement CMS data fetching
3. Map CMS data to artwork schema
4. Replace placeholder data with CMS content
5. Handle CMS-specific image optimization

**Deliverable**: CMS-powered artworks gallery

### Sprint 4: Polish & Performance (Week 4)
**Goal**: Production-ready implementation

**Tasks**:
1. Implement advanced image gallery features
2. Performance optimization and Core Web Vitals
3. Enhanced filtering and search capabilities
4. Error handling and loading states
5. Testing and accessibility improvements

**Deliverable**: Production-ready artworks section

## Technical Decisions & Constraints

### Architecture Decisions
- **Content Collections**: Use Astro's content collections for type safety
- **Static Generation**: Prioritize SSG for performance, SSR where needed
- **Component Islands**: Minimal client-side JavaScript for interactions
- **Image Strategy**: Leverage Astro's image optimization

### Performance Targets
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (artwork page loads)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (stable layout during image loads)
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal JS for filtering interactions
- **Build Time**: < 30s with full artwork collection

### Development Principles
1. **Iterative Development**: Working prototype first, enhancements second
2. **Performance First**: Every feature decision considers Core Web Vitals impact
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for artwork data structures
4. **Component Reusability**: Build components for potential reuse
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Extend content collections schema for artworks
2. Create initial placeholder artwork data
3. Implement basic `/artworks` page structure
4. Set up artwork grid component

### CMS Integration Questions to Resolve
- What CMS are you currently using?
- How are images currently managed and served?
- What API endpoints are available for artwork data?
- Are there any authentication requirements for CMS access?

## Success Metrics
- **Technical**: Sub-2.5s page load, 95+ Lighthouse score
- **Functional**: Complete CRUD operations via CMS
- **User Experience**: Smooth filtering and artwork viewing
- **Development**: Easy to add new artworks and modify structure
