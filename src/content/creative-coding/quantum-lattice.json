  "description": "An interactive WebGL particle system featuring phase-driven dynamics, instanced rendering, and adaptive quality control. Explore quantum-inspired lattice formations with real-time parameter controls.",
  "creationDate": "2025-10-22",
  "technologies": ["WebGL", "Pure JavaScript", "Instanced Rendering", "GLSL Shaders"],
  "concept": "This piece explores the intersection of quantum physics concepts and visual computing. Particles move through a dynamic phase field, creating emergent patterns that evoke quantum lattice structures. The system uses multi-harmonic wave functions to generate complex, evolving behaviors from simple mathematical rules.",
  "technicalNotes": "Built entirely with pure WebGL (no frameworks), featuring instanced rendering for efficient particle management, framebuffer-based trail effects, and adaptive quality control that maintains 60 FPS by dynamically adjusting particle count. The phase field uses bilinear interpolation for smooth gradient calculations.",
  "inspiration": "Inspired by quantum field theory, the visualization of wave functions, and the beauty of emergent complexity in physical systems.",
