  "duration": "4 months",
  "team": "Joel Lithgow (UX), Tanza Solis (Dev), Stephanie Smith (Strategy), Nikol Plass (PM)",
  "role": "lead ux designer",
  "tools": "figma, google analytics, looker studio",
  "problem": "Users landing on CCA's homepage didn't understand what the institution was or where it was located. Analytics showed high bounce rates and users immediately clicking to the \"About\" page in the footer, indicating fundamental communication failure.",
  "solution": "Redesigned the homepage with a \"front door\" approach - immediately communicating CCA's identity, location in San Francisco, and value proposition before progressively revealing community content and conversion opportunities.",

    "The homepage needed to function as CCA's \"front door\" - balancing user needs for immediate brand understanding with admissions team conversion goals",
    "Users weren't getting essential information upfront: who CCA was, what programs were offered, and where they were located",
    "A strategic three-phase approach emerged: awareness (hero/identity), consideration (community/programs), conversion (CTAs)"
