  "insights": [
    "AI collaboration isn't just about coding faster—it's about creating space for higher-level creative and strategic decisions while maintaining technical excellence",
    "By chunking work into focused conversations and creating strategic briefs, I spent less time on repetitive coding tasks and more time refining content quality and design polish",
    "The AI advantage allows for rapid iteration cycles that would typically take weeks to achieve, but only when paired with clear strategic thinking and creative direction"
