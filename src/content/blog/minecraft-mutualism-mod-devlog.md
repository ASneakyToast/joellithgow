## Where It Started

I got into programming because of Minecraft.

Not through a CS degree, not through a bootcamp, not even through a "learn to code" website. I got into programming because I wanted to make Minecraft mods, so I sat down and watched Java tutorials on YouTube, trying to understand just enough to add custom blocks and mobs to the game.

After all these years—after professional development work, web apps, CMS projects, everything—I'm back. And it feels *right*.

## The Spark: A Book About Partnerships

I've been reading ["The Call of the Honeyguide" by Rob Dunn](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/rob-dunn/the-call-of-the-honeyguide/9781541605756/), and it's completely changed how I think about ecology. The book is about mutualisms—the reciprocal relationships between species where everyone benefits.

The title comes from one of nature's most fascinating partnerships: In sub-Saharan Africa, the greater honeyguide bird has evolved a specific call—used *only* to attract humans. The bird leads people to beehives because it wants the wax inside, but it can't access the hive on its own. Humans get honey, the bird gets wax. Everyone wins.

Reading this, all I could think was: "This would make an incredible Minecraft mod."

## The Vibe Code Session

Here's the wild part: I went from idea to working prototype in just a few hours.

How? Claude Code and pure creative flow—what I'm calling "vibe coding." No careful planning, no architecture documents, just: "I want to make a mod about mutualisms, let's start with the honeyguide."

The experience was surreal. I haven't touched Minecraft modding in years, but Claude helped me navigate the modern Fabric toolchain, set up the development environment, and start implementing game mechanics. It felt like pair programming with someone who had infinite patience for my "what if we tried this?" ideas.

## What We Built: Symbiotic Survival

The mod is called [Symbiotic Survival](https://github.com/ASneakyToast/minecraft-mutualisms-mod), and it's about teaching players that understanding and preserving natural partnerships is more rewarding than exploitation.

### The Honeyguide

The star of the show—these birds lead players to bee nests, just like their real-world counterparts. But here's where it gets interesting for game design:

**You don't learn this through a tutorial.** You learn it by watching.

Bee keeper villagers interact with honeyguides naturally. You see them following the bird, harvesting honey, and sharing larvae as a reward. The honeyguide remembers this positive interaction.

Then you see a pillager encounter a honeyguide. The bird tries to lead them to honey, but they just attack it. No honey, no understanding, no mutualism.

Players learn the mechanic through emergent storytelling, not UI pop-ups.

### Biome-Specific Mutualists

Each biome has its own pollinator-plant partnership:
- Fig wasps in jungle biomes
- Yucca moths in desert regions
- And eight more unique pairs across the world

Here's the core mechanic that makes it work: **Destroy the pollinator's home (nest, hive, etc.), and the nearby tree stops producing fruit.**

Want sustainable resources? Preserve the partnership. It's ecology 101 through gameplay consequences.

### The Technical Bits

Built for Minecraft Java Edition 1.21+ using the Fabric mod loader. Performance target is <10% server TPS impact because nobody wants their game to lag while learning about mutualism.

The most interesting technical challenge was the memory system for the honeyguides—making sure they could remember player interactions across game sessions without bloating save files. Claude helped me find an elegant solution using Minecraft's persistent data storage.

## What This Taught Me About Game Design

Building this reminded me why games are such powerful teaching tools. Nobody wants to read a textbook about fig wasps and their obligate mutualism with fig trees. But make it a game mechanic where destroying the wasp nest means no more figs? Suddenly players *care* about fig wasps.

The emergent storytelling with the villagers and pillagers was an accidental stroke of genius. I initially just wanted to test the honeyguide AI, but seeing how villagers vs. pillagers could demonstrate the mechanic organically... that's the kind of design that makes games special.

## The Vibe Coding Reflection

What strikes me most about this experience is how *fast* modern development can be when you combine:
- Deep domain knowledge (years of programming experience)
- Specific nostalgia/passion (Minecraft modding roots)
- AI assistance (Claude Code as a collaborative partner)
- Pure creative energy (the "vibe" in vibe coding)

I'm not saying AI wrote this mod for me—it didn't. But it handled all the boilerplate, helped me navigate unfamiliar APIs, and let me stay in creative flow instead of getting stuck on syntax or documentation. The ideas, the game design, the educational philosophy—that's all human. The execution speed? That's the AI partnership.

It's a mutualism of its own, really.

## Unexpected Discovery: How Claude Codes Differently for Games

Here's something I didn't expect: Claude Code approaches game development *completely differently* than web development.

In all my web projects—portfolio sites, CMS work, API development—Claude tends to go straight to production-ready code. Clean, complete implementations. When it says something is "done," it's done.

But with Minecraft modding? It's working in a fundamentally different mode.

### The Incremental Approach

Claude's strategy for this mod has been relentlessly incremental:
- Make sure a single block loads before worrying about the whole tree system
- Get items rendering properly before even touching mob spawning logic
- Test one mechanic in isolation before building the next layer

At first I thought this was just being cautious. But then I realized: it's actually the right approach for game development. Game mechanics need to be *felt* and *tested* iteratively in ways that web features don't.

### The TODO Philosophy

Here's where it gets interesting: Claude leaves TODOs *everywhere*.

```java
// TODO: Implement proper particle effects for pollination
// TODO: Add sound effects for honeyguide calls
// TODO: Optimize tree search algorithm for large forests
```

And then it marks the feature as "completed."

My web dev brain initially rebelled at this. "That's not done! There are TODOs!" But for rapid prototyping? This is actually ideal. The core mechanic works. The polish can come later. Claude's definition of "completion" in this context means "working prototype, next chunk unlocked."

I definitely prefer this for the creative exploration phase—but it requires vigilance. You need to know the difference between "works well enough to test the next idea" and "actually production ready."

### The Refactoring Moment

The tradeoff hit me when I discovered leaves were withering away even though they were attached to wood blocks.

Bug, right? Turns out: not exactly.

Through investigation, I found that Claude had set up our custom blocks using generic Minecraft block models—enough to get them rendering and testable, but not properly inheriting from the specialized `PillarBlock` and `LeavesBlock` classes they needed.

It was intentionally halfway. Test first, refactor to spec later.

So I spent time refactoring tree blocks to properly extend `PillarBlock`, leaves to inherit from `LeavesBlock`, getting all the proper behaviors instead of generic placeholders. Not hard, but something I hadn't expected to do after Claude said the blocks were "working."

### Different Domains, Different Workflows

What I'm learning: this placeholder-heavy, chunk-at-a-time approach actually makes sense for game development in a way it doesn't for web.

With web apps, you generally want components to be production-ready before you build the next layer on top. But with game mechanics, you need to *play* with rough implementations to know if they're even fun before you polish them.

The honeyguide's pathfinding didn't need to be perfect to test whether the "follow the bird" mechanic was engaging. The tree-pollinator relationship didn't need optimized neighbor-searching algorithms to validate that "destroy nest → no fruit" was the right game feel.

Claude seems to understand this implicitly. Or maybe game development just naturally encourages this workflow, and Claude adapts to it.

Either way: if you're using Claude Code for game development, embrace the TODOs. Embrace the placeholders. They're not tech debt—they're creative scaffolding.

Just remember to come back and actually implement them eventually.

## What's Next

Right now, it's a prototype. The honeyguide works, the basic pollination mechanics are in, and the emergent villager behavior is *chef's kiss*. But there's so much more I want to add:

- **More complex mutualism chains**: What if trees that depend on bird pollinators also provide fruit that feeds those birds? Break the chain anywhere and everything suffers.
- **Seasonal behaviors**: Migration patterns, seasonal blooms, hibernation cycles
- **Player education mechanics**: Maybe an in-game journal that fills in with observations, like Breath of the Wild's Hyrule Compendium
- **Consequences for restoration**: If you've damaged an ecosystem, can you restore the mutualism? What does that look like mechanically?

But honestly? Even if I just polish what exists now, I'm proud of it. It's a full circle moment—returning to where I started as a developer, but with years of experience and new tools that let me build in hours what would have taken weeks before.

## The Meta-Mutualism

There's something poetic about learning about mutualisms from a book, then using AI to rapidly prototype a game about mutualisms, which teaches players about mutualisms through gameplay.

Partnerships all the way down.
