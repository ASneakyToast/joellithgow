## Introduction

Over the past [TIME PERIOD], I've been deeply immersed in learning and working with AI tools across various projects - from web development and portfolio creation to creative problem-solving and technical challenges. This post serves as both a reflection on that journey and a resource for others embarking on similar paths.

**Why document this now?** Because the landscape is changing so rapidly, and the lessons I'm learning feel too valuable not to capture while they're fresh. This is meant to be a living document that I'll continue to update as I learn more.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### The Wagtail Scheduling Confusion
**The Problem:** One of the most frustrating experiences I've had was when Claude got confused about Wagtail's scheduling features between different versions of the CMS.

**What happened:** 
- Working on a Django/Wagtail project
- AI provided guidance based on outdated version information
- Led to implementation issues and debugging headaches
- [GitHub Issue Thread: Wagtail Scheduling Confusion](https://github.com/cca/cca-edu/issues/71)

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Always verify version-specific information** - AI training data can lag behind current software versions
2. **Cross-reference with official documentation** - Use AI as a starting point, not the final authority
3. **Document issues publicly** - GitHub issues help both you and others facing similar problems

### Version Control & Dependency Management
**Challenge:** Keeping AI-suggested dependencies up to date and compatible
- **Solution:** Developed a workflow for validating AI suggestions against current package versions
- **Tool:** Created custom scripts for dependency checking before implementation

### Django Migration Management Issues
**The Problem:** Claude consistently exhibits specific patterns when working with Django migrations that can create workflow issues.

**What happens:**
- Creates migrations on a per-app basis rather than considering cross-app dependencies
- Often generates migrations without meaningful names, relying on Django's auto-generated naming
- Frequently leaves migrations out of git commits, requiring manual review and addition
- Better at including migrations when explicitly asked to use a specified migration name

**Real-world impact:**
- Discovered during [CCA Educational Platform development](https://github.com/cca/cca-edu/issues/71)
- Led to inconsistent migration history and deployment issues
- Required establishing new workflows for migration management

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Always specify migration names explicitly** - "Create a migration named 'add_user_preferences'" vs. generic requests
2. **Review git status before committing** - Check that migrations are included in commits
3. **Consider cross-app dependencies** - Ask AI to analyze migration dependencies across the entire project
4. **Establish migration naming conventions** - Create clear patterns for AI to follow

**Solution workflow:**
1. Always request: "Create a migration named [descriptive_name] for [specific_change]"
2. After changes: "Show me git status and ensure all migrations are included"
3. Before deployment: "Review migration dependencies and execution order"

### GitHub Issue Creation and Label Management
**The Problem:** Claude frequently attempts to create new labels when creating GitHub issues, rather than using existing repository labels.

**What happens:**
```
⎿ Error: could not add label: 'content-management' not found

⏺ Let me try creating the issue with just the labels that exist in the repository:
```

**Real-world impact:**
- Issue creation fails when AI tries to use non-existent labels
- Workflow gets interrupted by label creation errors
- Requires manual retry with corrected label specifications

**Key Lesson:**
Always specify to use only existing repository labels to avoid label creation attempts in issue-focused sessions.

**Solution workflow:**
1. Request: "Create a GitHub issue using only labels that already exist in the repository"
2. Alternative: "First show me the existing labels, then create the issue with appropriate ones"
3. Context separation: Handle label management in dedicated sessions separate from issue creation

### Performance Optimization Learning Curve
**Challenge:** AI sometimes suggests solutions that work but aren't optimized for performance
- **Solution:** Learning to ask better questions about performance implications upfront
- **Example:** Asking "What are the performance considerations of this approach?" along with implementation requests

## Tools & Workflows That Changed Everything

### 1. Claude Code
**Game-changing features:**
- Contextual understanding of entire codebases
- Ability to work across multiple files simultaneously
- Excellent at explaining complex technical concepts

**Best practices I've developed:**
- Always provide full context about the project structure
- Ask for explanations along with implementations
- Use it for code reviews and architecture discussions

### 2. AI-Assisted Debugging
**Workflow that works:**
1. Describe the problem and expected behavior
2. Share relevant code snippets and error messages
3. Ask for multiple potential solutions with explanations
4. Test implementations incrementally

### 3. Content Creation & Documentation
**Where AI excels:**
- Creating structured outlines (like this blog post!)
- Generating comprehensive documentation from code
- Brainstorming creative angles for technical content

## Unexpected Learning Moments

### 1. AI as a Learning Accelerator
**Surprise discovery:** AI doesn't just help you build things faster - it helps you *understand* things faster.
- **Example:** Learning Astro's island architecture through collaborative explanation and implementation
- **Insight:** The best AI interactions are conversations, not just commands

### 2. Creative Confidence Boost
**Unexpected benefit:** Having AI as a brainstorming partner has made me more willing to attempt ambitious creative projects.
- **Example:** The interactive portfolio elements I never would have tried before
- **Insight:** Sometimes you need a collaborator who never judges your "stupid" ideas

### 3. Better Problem Decomposition
**Skill development:** Working with AI has made me better at breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces.
- **Before:** Feeling overwhelmed by big technical challenges
- **After:** Naturally thinking in terms of step-by-step solutions

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### 1. Over-reliance on AI Suggestions
**Pitfall:** Implementing solutions without understanding them
**Solution:** 
- Always ask "Can you explain why this approach works?"
- Implement incrementally and test each step
- Keep learning fundamental concepts alongside AI assistance

### 2. Version & Context Confusion
**Pitfall:** AI providing outdated or framework-specific solutions
**Solution:**
- Always specify versions and context upfront
- Verify suggestions against current documentation
- Test in small, isolated environments first

### 3. Scope Creep in AI-Assisted Projects
**Pitfall:** AI makes everything seem possible, leading to overambitious project scope
**Solution:**
- Define clear project boundaries before starting
- Use AI for feasibility checking, not just implementation
- Regular check-ins on project scope and timeline

### 4. Migration and Database Change Neglect
**Pitfall:** AI-generated database changes often omit proper migration management
**Real Example:** Working on Django projects where migrations were consistently generated without meaningful names and excluded from commits
**Solution:**
- Always explicitly request: "Create a migration named [descriptive_name]"
- Run `git status` after any database changes to verify migrations are included
- Establish and communicate clear migration naming conventions
- Ask AI to consider cross-app migration dependencies

### 5. Not Documenting Learning
**Pitfall:** Moving too fast and not capturing valuable insights
**Solution:**
- Keep learning logs (like this post!)
- Share discoveries with others
- Create reference materials for future projects

## Final Thoughts

The most important lesson I've learned is that AI is not a replacement for learning - it's an accelerator for learning. The developers who will thrive in this new landscape are those who use AI to deepen their understanding, not to avoid it.

Every challenge documented here, every success celebrated here, is part of a rapidly evolving landscape. What's true today might be different tomorrow, and that's exactly why documenting this journey feels so important.

**What's next for this post?** I plan to update this regularly as I continue learning. If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to hear your experiences and lessons learned.
